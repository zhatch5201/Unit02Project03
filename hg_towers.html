                                Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
                            Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
                            Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
                            Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
                            the administration of a city. Each role provides 
                            a different ability and strategy. However, 
                            one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
                            must be constantly aware of betrayal 
                            and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
                            of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
                            and expansion packs available for larger parties. <br /><br />
                            
                            This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
                            carefully choose his or her roles and 
                            the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
                            of a card. However the level of randomness is 
                            just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
                            overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
                            recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
                            players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
                            and some of the game appeal.

                                  Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
                                just about perfect and each player must 
                                carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
                                strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
                                the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
                                high and gets even better when you replace 
                                some of the cards with new cards available in the 
                                expansion packs.

                                  We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
                                to 6 players and we can strongly 
                                recommend the game. The different phases of the 
                                game are interesting and intriguing, from
                                bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
                                With the variety of cards and 
                                scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
                                a great introduction to the world of 
                                strategic board games and role playing.

                                <h3>An Incredible Game</h3>
                                <p>
                                        The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
                                        and one of the best around. As 
                                        for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
                                        are tough decisions to make every 
                                        turn. It's not only important to select the character 
                                        that increases your chances for scoring, 
                                        but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
                                        are likely to select, and then hedge against 
                                        their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
                                        and deep strategic thinking. However, 
                                        it can still be played at a more basic level for 
                                        younger users.<br />
                                        We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
                                        Best in its Class. Highly recommended.<br />
